SciTransNet is an AI-powered scientific translation and simplification tool developed with ASP.NET Core and React. Designed to enhance the accessibility of technical and academic content, SciTransNet leverages TextRazor’s NLP engine to analyze complex scientific texts and generate intelligent, structured outputs.

The system supports three advanced translation modes:

	• Simplify – rewrites content into clear, student-friendly explanations using approachable language.
	• Academic – transforms statements into scholarly, formally-structured text ideal for publications and professional use.
	• Concept – breaks down dense material into its core components, offering summaries, explanations, and key terms for conceptual understanding.

With deep linguistic analysis and topic detection, SciTransNet enables researchers, educators, and students to collaborate and understand scientific information more effectively across disciplines and languages.
